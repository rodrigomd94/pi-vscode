[![VS Code Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/pi0.pi-vscode?label=VS%20Code%20Marketplace&color=blue)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pi0.pi-vscode) [![Open VSX](https://img.shields.io/open-vsx/v/pi0/pi-vscode?label=Open%20VSX&color=purple)](https://open-vsx.org/extension/pi0/pi-vscode)

Minimal VS Code extension for [pi coding agent](https://pi.dev/).

## Features

- **Terminal-based** — Opens pi as an integrated terminal with full TUI/PTY support (opens beside the editor)
- **VS Code bridge** — Bundles a pi extension and local bridge so pi can query live editor state
- **Editor awareness** — pi can inspect the active editor, current/latest selection, open editors, workspace folders, and VS Code diagnostics (LSP / lint / type errors)
- **Status bar button** — PI button in the status bar for quick access
- **Open with file context** — Send current file path and line range (or cursor position) to pi, available from the editor title bar
- **Send selection** — Send selected text directly to the pi terminal
- **`@pi` chat participant** — Use `@pi` in VS Code Chat for streamed RPC-backed replies while keeping the terminal workflow for normal Pi sessions
- **Package manager** — Browse, search, install, and uninstall pi packages from the sidebar with live output streaming and cancel support; automatically detects package capabilities (extensions, skills, prompts, themes)
- **Auto-detection** — Finds the pi binary automatically from common paths (`~/.bun/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `~/.npm-global/bin`)

## Requirements

- `pi` CLI installed (`npm i -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` or `bun i -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`)
- An API key configured for at least one provider

## Install

Available on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pi0.pi-vscode) and [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/pi0/pi-vscode):

```bash
# VS Code / Cursor
ext install pi0.pi-vscode

# Open VSX (VSCodium, etc.)
ovsx get pi0.pi-vscode
```

## Commands

| Command              | Keybinding       | Description                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `Pi: Open`           | `Ctrl+Alt+3`     | Open or focus the pi terminal     |
| `Pi: Open with File` | Editor title bar | Open pi with current file context |
| `Pi: Send Selection` | —                | Send selected text to pi terminal |

## Sidebar

The **Pi** activity bar icon opens a sidebar with:

- **Packages view** — Search the npm registry for `pi-package` packages, see capability labels (extensions, skills, prompts, themes), install/uninstall with live streamed output, and cancel in-progress operations

## Bridge tools exposed to pi

Each pi terminal launched by the extension loads a bundled pi extension that can call back into live VS Code APIs.

| `vscode_save_document`        | Saves a document through VS Code                                                                 |

### Notes

- Paths accepted by file-based bridge tools can be absolute or workspace-relative.
- `vscode_get_code_actions` accepts either `selection` or explicit `start` / `end` positions.
- `vscode_execute_code_action` only works with an `actionId` returned by the most recent `vscode_get_code_actions` calls while that cached entry still exists.
- `vscode_apply_workspace_edit` applies one or more `{ filePath, range, newText }` replacements via VS Code rather than editing files behind the editor's back.
- `vscode_format_range` accepts either `selection` or explicit `start` / `end` positions.
- `vscode_format_document` / `vscode_format_range` use VS Code formatting providers and apply formatter-generated `TextEdit[]` results with `workspace.applyEdit`, which is safer for open or dirty buffers than shelling out.
- `vscode_get_notifications` supports `since` and `limit` parameters for incremental polling.

These bridge tools let pi inspect selections, diagnostics, symbols, definitions, declarations, implementations, hover/type info, workspace-wide symbol search, references, quick-fix availability, dirty state, and recent IDE events, while also safely opening files, saving buffers, applying workspace edits, formatting open buffers through VS Code providers, running VS Code code actions, and surfacing notifications back to the user.

## Using Pi from External Terminals

By default, bridge tools only work when pi is launched from a VS Code terminal. To enable bridge tools from any terminal (Ghostty, kitty, etc.) while VS Code is open:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-vscode-bridge
cp ~/.vscode/extensions/pi0.pi-vscode-*/bridge/pi-vscode-global.js ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-vscode-bridge/index.js
```

This installs the global bridge extension. When pi starts in any terminal, it will:

1. Check if VS Code's bridge is running via `~/.pi-vscode-bridge.json`
2. Register all VS Code bridge tools if a valid bridge is found
3. Show a TUI widget with the active VS Code file and selection

To disable, remove the directory: `rm -rf ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-vscode-bridge`

## Configuration

| Setting          | Default | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pi-vscode.path` | `""`    | Absolute path to the pi binary (auto-detected if empty) |
